        //executable file are saved in .class and are changed into bytes
        //jvm convert byte code into native code->machine understandable code
        //main part is executable part in java
        //function does a particular work for us
        //where class help to seperate one from the other
        //java is a typed language
        //i.e we have to predetermine the data types
        //they are of two types
        //primitive->bytes,short,char,boolean,int,long,float,double
        //non-primitive->string,array,class,inderitance,object
