 * Encapsulation is the process of 
 * combining data and functions into 
 * a single unit called class. 
 * 
 * 
 * In Encapsulation, the data is not 
 * accessed directly; it is accessed 
 * through the functions present inside 
 * the class. 
 * In simpler words, attributes of the 
 * class are kept private and public 
 * getter and setter methods are provided 
 * to manipulate these attributes. 
 * Thus, encapsulation makes the 
 * concept of data hiding possible.
 * (Data hiding: a language feature to 
 * restrict access to members of an 
 * object, reducing the negative effect 
 * due to dependencies. 
 * e.g. "protected", "private" feature in 
 * Java).
